Swift Adventures In Monad Land
========

Question: Is it vital to understand the concept of Monads to program in Swift?

Answer: No.

But it's an interesting topic nonetheless and if you tinker with Swift enough you'll find yourself doing monadic things, perhaps without realising.

The purpose of this repository is to explore concepts relating to the 'M' word in Swift. The ideas are developed from talks I gave at [Swift London Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/swiftlondon/) and [Swift Summit](https://www.swiftsummit.com) and are presented as Xcode Playground files.
